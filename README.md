# MorseVirus

Hello, I'm Reyhz an aspiring Game Developper !

This game is made for the [One Button Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2024)
It's also one of my first game jam that I'm participating on !



# Description

You downloaded cute cat GIFs to show them to your friends but one of them was infected with a deadly computer virus !
It disabled all your keyboard keys except one, and is now attacking your system to steal your precious data ( of numerous Cute Cat GIFs ).
To defend yourself you will have to type out anti-virus countermeasures, but how can you do it with only one key ? This is where Morse that your grandpa' thaught you will comme in handy...
